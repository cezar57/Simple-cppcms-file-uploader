This is a simple file uploader.

To upload files you just have to open a terminal instance and navigate to the containing folder.
Afterwards type : make uploader (if it is the first use) or make all (if you used it before or if you have made some changes especially to the view.tmpl file).

The uploader needs a directory called uploads and it creats it once you run the Makefile and there is where the uploaded files are stored.

Then type in the terminal ./config -c config.js and keep the terminal instance opened.

You can then open a web browser(ie. Google Chrome) and type http://localhost:8080/uploader

Once you're there you can browse for files in your computer and choose the name you want them to appear with.

After that click Upload and you will see that they appear in the frame below and you can download them by simply clicking on their names.
